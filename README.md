# COMP-330-Team-B-Project
First assignment in the Software Development course at college. Our Professor had put us into teams and given us the task of creating a program that will help solve a gradeschooler's homework assignement. An example of this assignment can be found in the docs folder.

I was responsible for completing AnotherRunner.java.

# Purpose of Project
This first assignment is aimed at ensuring basic preparation in data structures and objectoriented principles. It is done as a team so teamwork is emphasized from the beginning. Team members will need to demonstrate not only the ability to write a working program but to begin using best practices in modern software engineering to demonstrate daily progress on the project. This includes, but is not limited to requirements analysis and documentation, system design, version control (using GitHub), basic task management, testing, and documentation. This is an assignment aimed at ensuring you are prepared for the challenging work we'll be doing in COMP 330 this year. It is also an example of what to expect from real-world software engineering: where you and your team may find yourself having to fill in many missing details, even to understand the assignment.
